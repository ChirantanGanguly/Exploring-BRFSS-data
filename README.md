# Exploring-BRFSS-data

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. 

I have used this data to answer 3 research questions using data visualizations, using R programming Language.

## Research Questions:

1. Among non-institutionalized adults in the US, we investigate any differences in alcohol comsumption between veterans and nonveterans. The results could indicate whether veterans are at a lower or higher risk of alcohol addiction. We note that respondents are likely to underreport their alcohol consumption, leading to a possible bias in the data.

2. Among non-institutionalized adults in the US, we investigate any differences in general health condition depending on the the income level of the individual. We also try to investigate if being a smoker adversely affect the general health of the individual.

3. Among non-institutionalized adults in the US, Is a respondentâ€™s Body Mass Index (BMI) affect their chances to get depressive disorders? Is there any difference between genders? This is an interesting question as it looks for linkage between opinion about their mental health to a slightly more objective measure of overall health. The difference between genders is also interesting, as one can tease out different perceptions and pressures within society.
