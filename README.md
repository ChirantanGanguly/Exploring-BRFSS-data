# Exploring-BRFSS-data

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population. 

I have used this data to answer 3 research questions using data visualizations, using R programming Language.
